# Water We Gonna Do?

## About Our Project

We are Ritayan Chakraborty, Michelle Ng, and Celina Qi and our CS171 final project provides insight into the severity of the global water crisis. 

## Github Repository
The code we worked with lies in the cs171-project/assets folder. We used two different HTML files - one for the first page with the liquid fill gauge and the counters and one for the second page with the rest of the visualizations. This was mostly due to the fact that we wanted to break up the visualizations to better engage the user. The first page is intended to be short, personal, and pack a punch - we designed it to deliver hard facts about the water crisis that would make the user care about the issue. After the last counter especially, the user may even feel rather helpless when reading about the tragic consequences the water crisis has had on human life around the world. However, as the user clicks to the second page, they should even feel that they are taking back control in a way- by learning about the more intimate details of the crisis and the solutions that they themselves can take, we hope that the user will realize the impact that they can have in helping alleviate the crisis and feel empowered to start making a difference themselves. 

We separated our code into different js files for each different set of visualizations, and mainly each took responsibility for one type of visualization. As such, all of the information pertaining to the water calculator lies in the water-calculator.js folder, all of the information regarding the choropleth lies in choropleth.js, etc. 

Our styling css code all lie in our css folder, as well as the images and icons we use throughout our website.
